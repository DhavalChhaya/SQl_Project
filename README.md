# SQL Analysis of Global Famous Paintings

## Project Overview
This project involved a detailed analysis of famous paintings displayed worldwide, leveraging pre-existing data provided in CSV files. The SQL queries, stored separately, were designed to perform complex analytics on relationships between different entities in the art world, such as museums, artists, and artworks, to uncover trends in exhibition, pricing strategies, and museum operations.

## Key Findings
- **Unexhibited Artworks:** Identified artworks that are not currently displayed in any museums, providing insights that could guide curatorial decisions.
- **Museum Painting Holdings:** Investigated potential underutilization of museum spaces lacking any paintings.
- **Pricing Strategies:** Analyzed the discrepancies between asking and regular prices, pinpointing artworks that are potentially underpriced.
- **Operational Insights:** Determined operational trends by identifying museums that are open on both Sundays and Mondays, which can aid in planning and scheduling.
- **Geographical Distribution:** Analyzed the distribution of museums and paintings to highlight cultural hubs and potential areas for development.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Handling:** Utilized CSV files for SQL analysis, managing complex datasets effectively.
- **Complex SQL Query Construction:** Demonstrated proficiency with advanced SQL techniques including JOINs, subqueries, window functions, conditional expressions, and aggregation functions.
- **Analytical Reasoning:** Interpreted complex relationships within the data to derive meaningful insights that are relevant to real-world scenarios in the art sector.
- **Data Presentation:** Presented findings clearly and effectively, ensuring they are easily understandable and impactful.
- **Technical Documentation:** Prepared detailed SQL query documentation to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.
